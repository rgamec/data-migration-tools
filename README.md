## Introduction
Collection of old data migration and web scraping scripts in case anyone else can still find some value in them. Stability and reliability of any of the scripts not guaranteed.

## Todo
Better documentation and debugging for all scripts, as well as test-runs to see how well they still work, given changing database schemas and web page layouts over time.
